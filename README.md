# AISIGA
An evolutionary classification algorithm based on a combination two bio-inspired techinques: Artificial immune systems (AIS) and island genetic algorithms (IGA).

The algorithm evolves cluester or "antibodes" that attempt to classify the "antigens" or dataset cases. An antibody that connects to an antigen will vote for the antigen to belong to its class.

Code for the master project of Andreas Norstein and Eirik Baug

Written in Java 11

# Example runs
Antibodies are the circles, while the antigen (training cases) are the squared. Different classes are depicted with different colours.
